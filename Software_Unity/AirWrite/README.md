# Parkinson's Disease Hand Tremor Analysis and Stabilization Device - Computer Virtual Reality

## Project Description

This project focuses on the Computer Virtual Reality (VR) component of a system designed to analyze and stabilize hand tremors in Parkinson's disease patients. It involves developing a Unity VR application to record patient hand tremor data for clinical diagnosis and analysis.

## Key Features

*   **Unity VR Game Development**:
    *   Design of virtual reality scenes to simulate daily activities (e.g., unlocking, holding a water cup).
    *   Development of code to receive and record hand tremor data transmitted from the wearable device.
    *   Development of a user interface for VR display and interaction.
    *   Development of data analysis tools to analyze the recorded hand tremor data.

## Technical Details

*   **Game Engine**: Unity
*   **Programming Language**: C#
*   **VR Device**: (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)
*   **Communication Protocol**: (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP)
