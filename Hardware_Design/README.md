    *   Integration of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for hand tremor data acquisition.
    *   Integration of a gyroscope to provide physical stabilization.
    *   Design of a power management circuit to ensure stable system operation.
    *   Design of a communication interface (e.g., Bluetooth) for data transmission.
*   **Enclosure Design**:
    *   Design of an ergonomic wearable glove enclosure.
    *   Ensuring secure mounting and protection of hardware components.
    *   Consideration of patient comfort and convenience.
*   **Circuit Design**:
    *   Design of sensor signal processing circuits.
    *   Design of gyroscope control circuits.
    *   Design of power supply and distribution circuits.
    *   Design of communication interface circuits.
