## 1. Glove_Function
This module manages the STM32 microcontroller for the glove device, including:
- Processing sensor data within the glove
- Controlling the motor and stabilizing hand tremors
- Implementing communication protocols (I2C)
- Developing firmware and optimizing algorithms

## 2. Hardware_Design
This module focuses on the electronic and mechanical design of the glove, including:
- Circuit design and PCB layout
- 3D modeling and mechanical development
- Power management and port configurations

## 3. VR_Unity_Application
This module develops a VR application for rendering the glove device and tracking hand posture, including:
- Hand gesture tracking and posture detection
- 3D model rendering and interaction
- VR integration and application development

Here is a demonstration of how the glove is visualized and functions in a virtual reality environment:
